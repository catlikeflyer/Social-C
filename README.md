# Social-C, a private social media 
Private social media build using React and Firebase, with Reactstrap as a CSS framework for React.
Post To-Dos, memories and suggest music with your private circle.
# Issues
- When adding a new card (memory or to-do), right after the page becomes irresponsive. Refresh the page for it to add another card.
- Default bootstrap design.
